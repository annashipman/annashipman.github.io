<p>I like to write games in my spare time. Here are some of them.</p>


<div class="left-2-column">

<h3>Snake</h3>
<p>My version of the Nokia phone game. Purely for experimental purposes. This is
version 1.0 – playable, but not perfect; comments and suggestions are
welcome.</p>
<p>Java; <a href="https://github.com/annashipman/Snake">repo on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>Bacteria Warfare!</h3>
<p>Your job is to stop the bacteria going down the plughole and blocking the sink for as long as possible. Bacteria are (of course!) repelled if you are a different colour: CNTRL changes colour. Or you can lure them away by planting food of their own colour: SPACE.</p>
<p><a href="games/bacteriaggj.html">Play it!</a> (requires Flash)</p>
<p>ActionScript; <a href="https://github.com/annashipman/bacteria-warfare">repo on GitHub</a></p>
<p>This game was created as part of the <a href="http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2010/bacterial-warfare" target="_blank">Global Game Jam 2010</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="right-2-column">
<h3>Tetris</h3>
<p>This is WIP. I am exploring developing a game using TDD. It's completely unplayable at the moment but the tests all pass!</p>
<p>Java; WIP on <a href="https://github.com/annashipman/Tetris">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>A Serpent's Tale</h3>
<p>Jump and catch the stars or just roll along and see the circle of life rolling along too.</p>
<p>Unity, "JavaScript"; source files and instructions for game play can be found
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2012/serpents-tale-0">here</a>.</p>
<h3>For Flock's Sake</h3>
<p>Your job is to herd the birds into the holding pen using their natural
flocking behaviour.<p>
<p>Python, PyOpenGL, PyGame; source <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2011/flocks-sake">here</a>.</p>
