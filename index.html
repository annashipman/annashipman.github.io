<date>03 April 2014</date>
<p>At <a href="http://www.scalesummit.org/">ScaleSummit</a> last week, I proposed a session on running Open Source projects. I am hoping to move the project I’m working on, <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools">vCloud Tools</a>, from being <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/">coded in the open</a> to being Open Source and wanted to get the benefit of the accumulated wisdom. It was an excellent session and I really got a lot out of it. The executive summary is that if you are trying to build a community, you need to optimise for bringing people into the community, and a lot of the discussion focused around that. Here are some of the main things that I took away from it.</p>

Here are some of the resources that I send on to them.
