  <h2>How Anonymous Submissions Affected Gender Balance at our Conference</h2>
<date>17th November 2013</date>
<p>Mainly inspired by <a href="http://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/09/17/beating-the-odds-how-we-got-25-percent-women-speakers.html" target="_blank">this article</a>, I proposed that we make submissions anonymous for <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2013/" target="_blank">SPA2013</a>. The committee (four of us) discussed what we thought the outcome would be for some time, before deciding to just try it and see how it worked out. And here's the answer.</p>

    <h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
<date>6th July 2013</date>
<p>The first day at a new job is always a bit nerve-wracking. In a recent
session at <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2013/" target="_blank">SPA
2013</a>, we came up with some things a developer joining a new team can do to get up to speed quickly.</p>

    <h2>Roof Bug-fixing</h2>
<date>21st May 2013</date>
<p>I often find myself viewing life through the lens of software development, a bit like when you play too much Tetris and all your friends turn into shapes. But recent events have made me think: maybe other things actually would be better if they were more like software development?</p>

    <h2>Upgrading to 12.04...</h2>
<date>6th May 2013</date>
<p>I needed to write some code. Thanks to George Brocklehurst, I was no longer content to do this on my personal laptop using gedit â€“ I required Vim.</p>
<p>But I could not upgrade Vim!</p>

including partitioning, mounting, and other things I'd heard of but had never
done myself.</p>

    <h2>Roof Hacking</h2>
<date>24th March 2013</date>
<p>Two weeks ago I was at the excellent <a href="http://devfort.com/" target="_blank">/dev/fort</a>. More on that another time; all I'll say now is that we were making a website in a <a href="http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/fort-clonque-7423" target="_blank">fort</a>.</p>

    <h2>How to Estimate</h2>
<date>21st January 2013</date>
<p>I want to share this great idea about estimating that came from the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/mnowster" target="_blank">Mazz Mosley</a>. Instead of worrying about estimating in hours or days, estimate in story points as follows:</p>
