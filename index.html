<date>01 March 2015</date>
<p>I have wanted to be a technical architect since I started out in IT, and last September I was delighted to achieve this long-held goal. But very quickly I realised that, while it was clear to me that the role of a technical architect is overseeing the technical aspects of large software projects, I really wasn't sure what that meant I should be focusing on day-to-day. So I turned to some of the brilliant technical architects I know, both colleagues and elsewhere in the industry, for their advice.</p>
