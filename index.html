<date>17 May 2014</date>
<p>At <a href="http://2014.scottishrubyconference.com/">Scottish Ruby Conference</a> earlier this week, among the many great talks I attended was <a href="http://twitter.com/jessabean">Jess Eldredge</a>'s excellent <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jessabean/sketchnoting-creative-notes-for-technical-content">introduction to sketchnoting</a>.

<date>03 April 2014</date>
<p>At <a href="http://www.scalesummit.org/">ScaleSummit</a> last week, I proposed a session on running Open Source projects. I am hoping to move the project I’m working on, <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools">vCloud Tools</a>, from being <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/">coded in the open</a> to being Open Source and wanted to get the benefit of the accumulated wisdom. It was an excellent session and I really got a lot out of it. The executive summary is that if you are trying to build a community, you need to optimise for bringing people into the community, and a lot of the discussion focused around that. Here are some of the main things that I took away from it.</p>

<p>As co-Programme Chair for <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/" target="_blank">SPA conference</a> I often find myself trying to persuade inexperienced or completely new speakers that it is worth doing and that they have something great to say.

<date>17 November 2013</date>
<p>Mainly inspired by <a href="http://2012.jsconf.eu/2012/09/17/beating-the-odds-how-we-got-25-percent-women-speakers.html" target="_blank">this article</a>, I proposed that we make submissions anonymous for <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2013/" target="_blank">SPA2013</a>. The committee (four of us) discussed what we thought the outcome would be for some time, before deciding to just try it and see how it worked out. And here's the answer.</p>

<p>The first day at a new job is always a bit nerve-wracking. In a recent
session at <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2013/" target="_blank">SPA

<p>I often find myself viewing life through the lens of software development, a bit like when you play too much Tetris and all your friends turn into shapes. But recent events have made me think: maybe other things actually would be better if they were more like software development?</p>

<p>I want to share this great idea about estimating that came from the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/mnowster" target="_blank">Mazz Mosley</a>. Instead of worrying about estimating in hours or days, estimate in story points as follows:</p>
