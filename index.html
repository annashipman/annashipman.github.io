    <h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
<date>6th July 2013</date>
<p>The first day at a new job is always a bit nerve-wracking. In a recent
session at <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/spa2013/" target="_blank">SPA
2013</a>, we came up with some things a developer joining a new team can do to get up to speed quickly.</p>

    <h2>Roof Bug-fixing</h2>
<date>21st May 2013</date>
<p>I often find myself viewing life through the lens of software development, a bit like when you play too much Tetris and all your friends turn into shapes. But recent events have made me think: maybe other things actually would be better if they were more like software development?</p>

    <h2>Upgrading to 12.04...</h2>
<date>6th May 2013</date>
<p>I needed to write some code. Thanks to George Brocklehurst, I was no longer content to do this on my personal laptop using gedit – I required Vim.</p>
<p>But I could not upgrade Vim!</p>

    <h1>Partitioning!</h1>
<date>24th April 2013</date>
<p>Today I learned from the awesome <a
href="https://twitter.com/rjw1" target="_blank">bob</a> how to add storage to a box,
including partitioning, mounting, and other things I'd heard of but had never
done myself.</p>

    <h2>Roof Hacking</h2>
<date>24th March 2013</date>
<p>Two weeks ago I was at the excellent <a href="http://devfort.com/" target="_blank">/dev/fort</a>. More on that another time; all I'll say now is that we were making a website in a <a href="http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/search-and-book/properties/fort-clonque-7423" target="_blank">fort</a>.</p>

    <h2>How to Estimate</h2>
<date>21st January 2013</date>
<p>I want to share this great idea about estimating that came from the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/mnowster" target="_blank">Mazz Mosley</a>. Instead of worrying about estimating in hours or days, estimate in story points as follows:</p>

    <h2>Learning the perls</h2>
<date>20th November 2012</date>
<p>After some time muddling through with Perl, I have accepted the inevitable – it's time to actually knuckle down and learn it properly. I have acquired <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Perl-Randal-L-Schwartz/dp/1449303587/" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Perl-chromatic/dp/0977920178/" target="_blank">books</a>, but I also require some direction – so I asked my excellent colleague and friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cackhanded" target="_blank">Mark Norman Francis</a> to write a brief guest post for my blog.</p>

<date>19th July 2012</date>
<p>I had a really inspiring chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/mattb" target="_blank">Matt Biddulph</a> about D3 this week. He showed me some really cool things. I made some notes.</p>

    <h2>CAP again – or should that be PACELC?</h2>
<date>15th July 2012</date>
<p>The last thing I wrote about was the CAP Theorem. Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/thattommyhall" target="_blank">Tom Hall</a> visited our office and gave a very interesting talk, the central thesis of which was that the CAP Theorem, as often explained, is incorrect – or at least not very meaningful.</p>

    <h2>The CAP Theorem and MongoDB</h2>
<date>29th April 2012</date>
<p>This week I learned some things about MongoDB. One of them was about how it fits in with the CAP theorem.</p>
<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and I think this diagram from my excellent new colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/matwall" target="_blank">Mat Wall</a> while he was explaining it to me says everything:</p>
