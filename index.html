<date>29 March 2015</date>
<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a post about <a href="/jfdi/what-is-a-technical-architect.html">being a technical architect</a>, and one of my main conclusions was that you need to stay technical. But how?</p>

<date>01 March 2015</date>
<p>I have wanted to be a technical architect since I started out in IT, and last September I was delighted to achieve this long-held goal. But very quickly I realised that, while it was clear to me that the role of a technical architect is overseeing the technical aspects of large software projects, I really wasn't sure what that meant I should be focusing on day-to-day. So I turned to some of the brilliant technical architects I know, both colleagues and elsewhere in the industry, for their advice.</p>

How do I get more women to speak at my conference?</a></h1>
<date>08 December 2014</date>
<p>Last year I wrote about <a href="/jfdi/how-anonymity-affected-gender-balance.html">how anonymous submissions affected gender balance</a> at <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/">SPA conference</a>. Short answer: not hugely, but it did have some other positive effects. This year, however, we did have more women speaking at the conference than previously. Here are some suggestions for how to replicate this at your conference.</p>

<date>03 April 2014</date>
<p>At <a href="http://www.scalesummit.org/">ScaleSummit</a> last week, I proposed a session on running Open Source projects. I am hoping to move the project I’m working on, <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools">vCloud Tools</a>, from being <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/">coded in the open</a> to being Open Source and wanted to get the benefit of the accumulated wisdom. It was an excellent session and I really got a lot out of it. The executive summary is that if you are trying to build a community, you need to optimise for bringing people into the community, and a lot of the discussion focused around that. Here are some of the main things that I took away from it.</p>
