**first thing, pull in notes from the Note**

When I told my then mentor that I was joining the Financial Times as Technical Director for FT.com, one thing he recommended was that I meet everyone in my team for a one-to-one. He'd got this advice from his mentor, who used to be a Rear Admiral and said this was something you should do whenever you have a team of fewer than 150 people. I was initially resistant, but I did do it. This is how, and what I learned.

## Why I was resistnat

Mention working a 4 day week so bigger time commitment...
~55 people

## My mentor's advice about the content of the meeting

- Be clear about whether you will take action or whether this is for information only. He says the latter, and I plan to do the same.
- This should mostly be about listening - I should talk for maybe 5 minutes and they should talk for 25.
- It's to find out what's going well and what's not going well.
- It's informal, but you should make sure it's in an enclosed meeting room so that people feel they can speak freely.
- Sometimes it will be quite boring, sometimes you may just learn a lot about someone's family or hobbies, but that is useful from a getting to know people/relationship building perspective and it means that you know some things about that person.
- Aim is to get a bit about their background, their priorities and their pressures.

## How I set the meetings up

Firstly, in my introductory talk and email to the team, I said that I wanted to have a one-to-one with everyone. I then made a list of everyone and started inviting people. I tried to schedule four a week, and only a couple of weeks in advance, and I started with the people reporting directly to me and then on down the management chain.

In the meeting invitation I gave a lot of context:

<div class="quote">
<p>I mentioned that I wanted to have a chat with everyone on FT.com to understand how things are going, does this time suit you for this?</p>

<p>The meeting agenda is the same for everyone; a quick intro and then the following questions (I'll go through this in the meeting too):</p>

<ul>
<li>What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?</li>
<li>What will get in the way of us doing that?</li>
<li>What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?</li>
<li>Is there anything you think I should know about?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks,</p>

## Making notes felt too much like a promise

Each meeting was half an hour. In the very first one, I made notes in a notebook, but I realised that created an implicit commitment that I was going to take action on everything that was said, as well as meaning I couldn't be fully focused on what they were saying. So after that, I made a few notes after the meeting.

I don't have an amazing memory, so that meant I couldn't have more than two back to back and had to make sure I had time after each one to make a few notes.

## How I structured each meeting

I ran each meeting in the same way. Firstly I ran through everything I planned to cover, and then stepped through it.

### Introductory comments

- I am asking the same questions to everyone
- This is information for me only to get an idea of themes and how things are going; I'm not explicitly planning to take action on anything we discuss, so if something comes up that I need to take action on, let's make sure we discuss that after this meeting
- This is information for me only, it's confidential. If you say something about someone else I'm not going to go and tell them. I may report on 'what people are saying', but I'll say 'the engineers feel' or 'an engineer said'; I won't say "[Your name] said..."

### What we're going to discuss

- First I'll introduce myself, and tell you a bit about my background
- Then, if you like, I'd love you to tell me a bit about yourself - as much or as little as you feel like sharing
- Then we'll discuss the following questions:

1. What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?
1. What will get in the way of us doing that?
1. What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?
1. Is there anything you think I should know about?

I then literally ran through everything in the order I said I would.

## Is there anything I should know

Talk a bit more what I said in this question

## Introducing myself

In my intro, I gave a potted career history. Starting from my degree in philosophy, and my first career in [children's book publishing](https://www.barringtonstoke.co.uk/) through teaching myself to code, my [masters in Software Systems](https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/uk/postgraduate/information-technology-software-systems.htm) and then my 15+ year career in programming - ops engineering - technical architecture and being open source lead. I also talked about what appealed to me about the job, particularly that as open source lead, I really enjoyed the influencing part of the role and the impact, but I missed having a team.

I said roughly the same thing to everyone. I don't normally introduce myself and give my background, but in this case I thought that as a new tech director most of them would not be working closely with me, and I would not be contributing code, so it was worth giving my credentials.

I then gave a personal detail. My mentor had suggested I say something personal, but I think he intended something like "married with two children". Instead, I tried to give each person a different personal detail, for example something about my [cross-stitch hobby](https://twitter.com/annashipman/status/1043917006477643777).

This part was the hardest part for me, because in the past I've been generally quite reserved at work, keeping a clear boundary between work stuff and personal stuff, but something I've been trying to do is bring more of my personal life to work. It also led to some really interesting conversations, and trying to come up with a different personal detail for each person was an interesting exercise.

Giving so much information in my introduction also allowed the other person to introduce themselves how they wanted - career history/hobbies/etc.

## How did it go for me?

I am so glad I did this. My mentor was wrong about one thing – none of the conversations were boring. Building relationships...

But also gave me a brilliant insight into issues

## Was it useful for my team?

I asked a range of the people with whom I had the 1:1s whether they had been useful and their thoughts...

## Would I do it again?

I would definitely do it again if I was starting another job.

One thing I wondered was whether I should do this annually. The initial problem remains though, it's a huge time commitment - 28 hours; plus the time after each meeting to write notes; plus over time because I have a lot of other ongoing commitments.

At this stage, I have a lot of other ways of gathering information about how my team are doing; - peakon, spotify, tech strategy, open conversations with direct reports who keep me in the loop, so it would not be about information gatherintg and there are ohter ways to do relationship building, such as social events (some in work time) x, y, z.

One thing I do try and do is have a coffee with people when they leave the team, as that is another good opportunity to ask the "is there anythiung I shuld know" question.

## What would i do differently

Note for blog post, initially felt uncomfortable with a meeting with no actions
