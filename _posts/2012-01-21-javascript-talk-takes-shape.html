title: JavaScript Talk Takes Shape
layout: blog_post

<p>Just over a week to go until the final deadline for the SPA submissions, and the JavaScript visualisations talk is shaping up.</p>
<p>The plan is to demonstrate the use of a JS library to produce a certain kind of visualisation, followed by a 15-20 minute exercise where participants use the library to create a similar visualisation. I've said "rinse and repeat 4-5 times", though I'm slightly dubious as to whether we're going to have time to do more than three. <a href="https://twitter.com/hibri">Hibri</a> and I are going to do one each and demo to the other, so we'll have a better idea then of how many we can cover. I'm really excited about what we're going to produce!</p>
<p>At the moment we are planning to try and do:</p>
<ul>
<li>A force-directed graph (library tbc, possibly d3)</li>
<li>A sunburst diagram with JIT</li>
<li>An interactive line graph with Raphael</li>
<li>A bar chart (library tbc, possibly just using Canvas)</li>
<li>A stream graph (library tbc, possibly d3 if not using d3 for force-directed)</li>
<li>A heat map (library tbc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there a type of visualisation you'd really like to see us demonstrate, or a library you think we can't miss out? Please do let me know.</p>
<p>There is also still time to give feedback directly on this and all other proposals for SPA 2012 <a href="http://www.spaconference.org/scripts/proposals.php">here</a> (SPA login required).</p>
