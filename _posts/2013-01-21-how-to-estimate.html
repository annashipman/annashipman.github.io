<p>I want to share this great idea about estimating that came from the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/mnowster" target="_blank">Mazz Mosley</a>. Instead of worrying about estimating in hours or days, estimate in story points as follows:</p>
<div class="pretty-code-sample">
<p>1: This is trivial. I know exactly the code I would write if I went back to my desk right now.</p>
<p>2: This is quite easy. I know roughly what I'd have to do. I might have to look one or two things up.</p>
<p>3: This is a bit complex. I might have to refresh my memory on a few things and there are a couple of unknowns.</p>
<p>5: This is big. I have only a rough idea of how I'd do this.</p>
<p>8+: I don't know how to do this.</p>
</div>
<p>I've written 8+ rather than the more standard 8, 13, 21 etc because in our team we had an additional rule â€“ if it's 8+ then the story is too big and you need to break it down a bit more. Maybe have a timeboxed spike? Then you will have more information for the next planning meeting.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how much time each point ends up being (and this will vary from team to team); after a few sprints of estimating like this the velocity will become meaningful and you can use it for predicting how much work you'll get through in future sprints.</p>
