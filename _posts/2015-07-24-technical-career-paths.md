<p>Until recently, career development for technologists at GDS was
relatively unstructured, and dependent on what opportunities came up. Over the
last few months I’ve been leading on developing a more structured career path
for developers and web operations engineers. This blog post describes what that
involved.</p>

<h2>Working out our values</h2>
<p>First, we needed to be clear on what skills we expect someone to demonstrate
at each level (e.g. junior, senior). Every organisation has implicit cultural
values, and we wanted to draw these out as well as technical skills, so it’s
clear what behaviours we want to reward at GDS.</p>
<p>It's really important in government that people are well rounded, for example
having the skills to share externally the things we do at GDS, having an ability
to coach and lead colleagues. Making these things explicit is an important part
of the exercise, and is one reason why it’s hard to take a career path from
another organisation – their values might not reflect yours.</p>
<p>To identify these skills and values we held a series of facilitated workshops
with a group of people from our technology community. In order to involve more
of our technologists, <a href="https://twitter.com/rjw1">bob walker</a>, <a
href="https://twitter.com/danielroseman">Daniel Roseman</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/tombaromba">Tom Byers</a> gathered feedback between
the workshops from others in the web operations, backend development and
frontend development communities.</p>
<p>We also decided at this point that there shouldn't be a frontend/backend
distinction; many of the skills are the same, and we want to encourage people to
work across the full stack.</p>
<h2>Adding more technical skills</h2>
<p>The workshops produced an outline of what skills were expected at each level.
However, it was quite light on details of technical expertise. It's harder to
work that out by committee.</p>
<p>Myself, <a href="https://twitter.com/bradwright">Brad Wright</a> and <a
href="https://twitter.com/jystewart">James Stewart</a> – three technical
architects who are also senior line managers – listed the technical competencies
we expect at each level. We also talked to line managers to see how what we had
come up with fitted in with how we were already working on developing
people.</p>
<p>At this point we had an alpha version of the career paths document,
definitely not formatted as we would like, but with the information we had
learned in it. You can download the first version as a PDF: <a
href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/07/Developerweb-op-career-paths-v1.0.pdf">Developer:web
op career paths v1.0</a>.</p>
<h2>Use of the career path</h2>
<p>The main aim of the career path work is to help people clarify where they are
in their careers and what to focus on when working out how to progress, so the
way the document is meant to be used is in a conversation with your line manager
to talk about where you want to get to, and what practical things to focus on to
help you get there.</p>
<p>The conversation focuses on the four skill areas: technical expertise,
delivery, digital evangelism and leadership. So for example, you might be a
developer, with technical skills at a senior developer level, but weaker on
evangelism and leadership. If your goal is to get to senior developer, we would
work out some objectives that would help you develop in the evangelism skill
area (for example, blogging, speaking at events) and leadership (for example
being a tech lead, line management, or owning a non-technical project).</p>
<h2>Too much information!</h2>
<p>Once we had version 1.0 of the document, the next thing to do was use the
tech line managers as guinea pigs. I pitched the work so far and the
conversation template at a meeting of the tech line managers (there were about
18 at the time) and asked them to go through the process with their own line
managers and let us know how it went.</p>
<p>This process of user-testing was very useful and we learned a lot.</p>
<p>For example, one thing I had tried to make very clear was that this is not
meant to be a tick-box exercise. It should not be the case that if you can show
one example of each skill at each level, you automatically progress to the next
level. The examples are meant to be an indication of the sorts of things you can
be expected to do.</p>
<p>However, including so much detail at each level made it very hard to not do
it as a tick-box exercise. Contrary to what we had expected, we needed to
include less detail, to make it clearer that they were examples.</p>
<h2>It was a useful framework for working out specific areas of
development</h2>
<p>One important thing we discovered was that even though the document itself
still needed further development, the conversations using it were some of the
most constructive and useful line management conversations we’d had so far.</p>
<p>I line manage four people, and all four of them came out of our conversation
with useful, practical development objectives that they were able to immediately
start working on in order to develop their careers as a technologist within
GDS.</p>
<h2>It’s still a work in progress</h2>
<p>We’ve made some changes based on the feedback from the tech line managers,
and with input from <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesholloway">James
Holloway</a>, then a writer at GDS, we produced the next version, which you can
also download as a PDF: <a
href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/07/Career_pathing_for_technologists_v2.0.pdf">Career_pathing_for_technologists_v2.0</a>.
We’re now using it, and all technologists at GDS have had an opportunity to work
out their career plan with their line managers. There are still many areas for
improvement, and <a href="https://twitter.com/alicebartlett">Alice Bartlett</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/edds">Edd Sowden</a> and others are currently
working on the next iteration.</p>
<p>One interesting point is that we may have gone too far the other way on
removing detail. I suspect the way to balance this will be around how we
communicate the process, rather than reaching a genuinely “perfect” amount of
detail (this is another reason this document may not, as it stands, work for
your organisation).</p>
<p>There are also several areas we didn't touch on and will have to be addressed
in future. For example, this is not currently related to salary. The career
development conversation with your line manager is about where you sit at the
moment, where you would like to get to and what steps to take to get there,
purely from a skills and career development perspective.</p>
<p>In addition, at the moment this is separate to the annual review process,
though the areas for development identified here are really useful for working
out development objectives for the annual review process.</p>
<h2>It’s definitely been worth doing</h2>
<p>Working out our career paths has been a really useful process and we are now
doing it for other roles, such as delivery managers and designers. One important
thing we’ve learned is that while the finished artefact is useful, the process
of how you create that artefact is more important. It has to reflect what you
value as an organisation, and this process forces you to be clear about what
that is.</p>
<p>GDS started in 2011 with a small team of 12 people, and then grew very
rapidly until we numbered 600 in 2014. When your organisation is first getting
established, things like structured career development are rarely the top
priority. Now we are maturing and people are thinking about staying on for some
time, it’s critical to make sure we put these things in place.</p>
