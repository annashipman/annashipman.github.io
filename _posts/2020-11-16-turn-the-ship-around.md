Prompted by some discussions at work, I recently read [Turn the Ship Around!](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/turn-the-ship-around-a-true-story-of-building-leaders-by-breaking-the-rules/9780241250945). I enjoyed it. Here are my notes.

Maybe say here that I made A LOT of notes and have only written up the ones relevant to me right now so worth you reading as you may get completely different things from it.

## Making followers into leaders in the Navy

I had heard of this book, and seen this [short video (10 mins)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqmdLcyES_Q) with the key points. Recently, one of my team shared a link to the video when we were having a discussion about how to take more ownership, and watching it again I thought I would read the book to get the practical steps.

The context is fascinating, because thinking for oneself; being a leader at all levels rather than following orders, is expressly something I do not associate with the military. The book is essentially a case study of what L. David Marquet and his team aboard a nuclear submarine did to move from a "leader-follower" appraoch to a "leader-leader" approach. Each chapter illustrates an idea with an example, which makes it very easy to read, and then supplements it with questions you can use to think about how this idea could work in your own organisation. He ackowledges at the end that it didn't play out like that - they did some things and then afterwards worked out what the framework had been, but presenting it like this makes it very easy to follow and think about how to apply. I also find it much more powerful when a business book is written by someone who actually has the experience of implementing the ideas they write about (like [High Output Management](/jfdi/high-output-management.html), my favourite).

Note: not a list of prescriptions

## hontest about the challenges

Maybe say here about how he talks about things that went badly, his own worries, etc.

Something he struggled with all career - balancing the courage to hold people accountable for their actions with my compassion for their honest efforts. p. 118.

Caring but not caring - caring about subordinates and the organisation but little about the organisational consequences to yourself 

To promote long term success he had to ignore the short term reward system (duplicaetd elsewehre atm)

Didn’t do it when tired - fell back on and habits. Like per the pandemic. Too tired to engage in the discussion, felt like that’s all he did all day every day p87 Lots of times when he felt like going back to more expected style of leadership. Barking orders etc

## Leadership at all levels

The end result of the work the team did was a submarine where each crew member took responsibility for their own area, and some of the ways this manifested was that instead of the Captain making decisions, crew members would come to him and say "Captain, I intend to..." and he would say "very well" – and this was just the decisions he needed to know about. 95% of the decisions on board were taken without his input.

Leader leader structure meant a wide pool of talent so could let two senior people have leave at the same time.



## I intend to...

I intend to instead of I will 
And instead of asking questions, give enough information so captain just needs to say ok

So you need to think like your boss to understand what the questions are. No need of leadership redevelopment programs - the way we ran the ship *was* leadership development programs. 

What causes us to take control when we should be giving control? 
What would be the most challenging obstacle to “I intend to?”

Ways I think we could use this: Clarifying what done looks like
Checking out - proactively informing me of where they are. Rather than me chasing, because with me chasing I’m holding on to all the threads. I am responsible. 
As it's not "I intend to submerge the ship", the tasks are much larger, "I intend to spend time working on a proposal for how to make our content stores more consistent and cost-effective," could take some time...

## Letting go of control

Leadership- communicating people’s worth and potential to people so well they are inspired to see it themselves 
Empowerment doesn’t work - ie it takes me to empower you, which drowns out the message 

As control is divested, technical competence and organisational clarity need to be strengthened 

Repeated In ever increasing circles 

Let go of idea that there can be leaders and followers 


## Training

Created a creed - about learning (not training - too passive)

Learning mindset - learning while doing. “Instead of looking at a task as just a chore, look at it as an opportunity to learn more about the associated piece of equipment, the procedure, or if nothing else, about how to delegate or accomplish tasks.”

Love this bit  their creed 

“Therefore, our vision of our command is a learning and competence factory. The raw materials are the new personnel reporting aboard each week, new equipment, and tactics. The product is well-qualified, experienced sailors who, upon detaching from the command, carry their competence throughout the Navy. Each of you, then, is both a product of the factory (when you learn) and a machine in the factory (when you help others learn).

What do you expect me to do? I expect you to be a better submariner each day.”

Training programme then was actually an enabler that allowed them to pass decision-making authority to lower and lower levels. 

P.132 - revolutionary way of thinking about training!!
And a suggestion about how to do it - summarise the suggestion. 

He found the learning mindset helped his perspective too, allowed him to approach inspections calmly, even eagerly, rather than anxious about the result; and this impacted the crew as well who sensed this. 


## Introductory questions

One of the first things he did when taking command of the submarine was meet with each crew member and ask them a set of questions very simliar to [the ones I asked my team when I joined](/jfdi/meeting-everyone.html). (That was recommended to me by a previous mentor; he had been recommended it by a mentor of his, who was a Rear Admiral in the Navy, I wondered if there was a direct connection here!).

One question that he asked that I did not but liked and might well consider for next time was "What is the best thing I can do for you?" I like that because it's the beginning of people starting to think what the solution to their problems might be.


## Curiosity rather than rote questioning

He was in an interesting position in that he had trained for a different type of submarine, so when he joined this post he was not as technically competent as he expected to be and as the Navy traditionally expect leadership to be. He thus had to take a position of curiosity, and when he asked the crew questions about the equipment it wasn't to test them on their knowledge but because he genuinely did not know. Eventually he became fully technically competent on the ship but by then the patterns of interaction had been set.

I found this really interesting because it ties into my experience joining as Technical Director of a product that I didn't build, so could not hope to be anywhere near as technically competent with as the people who built it and work on it day to day. He talked about his own struggles with wanting to be the smartest person in the room, and I found this very insightful; one of the challenges with a "leader-leader" approach is having to let go of your idea of yourself as someone who has the answers and this can be very hard.

One of the questions he poses at the end of the section on this is "Is technical competence personal or organisational?" which is a very interesting question, and reminded me of thoughts around documentation, making sure everyone ... [pad out or kill this bit]

## Set clarity about goals

Specific goals and the freedom to choose.


Described a “tickler” - even well run ones still have the overhead of maintaining the tracker of work to do and having the supervisory meetings - giving control to team to think of a better way to understand and meet those goals

Required them to own the problem and the solution to it

RESIST THE URGE TO PROVUDE SOLUTIONS

Begin with the end in mind - 7 habits od highly effective people... (maybe I should read that next)

Rule with menotong meetings - could only talk about long term issues not operational. Asked them to write their end of tour awards (5 years out) or if too long then their next years prefrormance appraisal. P.191 how to write up and use that example. 

Wrote up but they wanted to achieve. And made it specific and measurable by asking questions like open “how would you know if this had been achieved?” And digging deeper: e.g. if it was “we’d have fewer critiques” next question is how many critiques did you have last year?  In the process they often learned that they hadn’t been keeping track of appropriate data. It meant the end of year reviews had concrete data in themSo instead of reduced significantly it would say reduced by 43%.

I wonder about getting us all to begin with the end in mind, all writing our iwn 3 year outcomes would help?

For how far in the future are you optimising your organisation?

## Emancipated not empowered

^ in above section? figure these out
 I wanted to make sure They deliberately decided to take charge. It wouldn’t be any good if I directed them. You can’t invoke leader follower rules to direct a shift from leader follower to leader leader

Not just in charge of leave but also watch bill, ie consequences of their actions. 

Emancipate rather than empower - decision making control, competence and clarity. When going well you no longer have the ability to empower them because they no are not longer relying on you for their source of power. 

And meant they could tell him he was wrong, questining orders

## Short early conversations are good

Short early conversations a mechanism for control - not me telling them what to do but an opportunity for them to get early feedback on how they were tackling problems. 

Demand for perfect products first time see them is a waste of subordinates time

Protecting executive time wastes more time overall 

Early conversation can unearth wel meaning but weroneaous translation of intent 

## Think out loud (both superiors and subordinates)

He talked about this as a mechanism for sharing context both ways. 

Thinking out loud. Constant buzz of informal communication 

When his crew didn’t think out loud, that was when he was tempted to step in and interferes. When he was thinking out loud it was imparting useful context and modelling that lack of certainty is strength ans certainty is arrogance.  

Do you ever walk round tonight’s what is communicated informally? How does that map into current working? Chat in slack?

How can you create an environment jn which people express their uncertainty and fears as well as innovative ideas ans hopes. 

## Delegating authorigy further

All monitor your own departments and responsible for getting the work done (works when there are clear areas, one challenge we have is that we don't quite have that, I will come back to that)

As authority is delegated, technical competence at all levels becomes more important. 

Don’t move information to authority, move authority to where the information is 

If you ask people what authorities they would like in order to make their jobs easier you’ll definitely get some ideas. 

Eliminate top down monitoring
Some things missed but everyone responsible for their own department and their own work 


What mechanisms/processes can be changed to delegate authority further? OKRs...?

(Maybe note not just pricnipals but teams that ereport to them...)

What do I, as a proponent of the leader leader approach need to delegate to show I am willing to walk the talk? ...? I need to talk less in meetings cf the improving everything 5% idea  - relate to what Etienne said


## Success is measured by what happens after you leave

Something that really resonated with me is how he talks about your legacy as a leader. He notes that a lot of ships would be described as a "good ship" but then the captain moves on and they become a "bad ship" - and correctly notes that what this means is that the captain is the one making this happen (and gives examples of captains working really long hours, running around to make sure every job is being done the way they'd like). If you leave, and the organisation collapses behind you then you have not truly built a good organisation.

He can say his methods were successful because "Only ten years later can we assess the true success of the work - continued operational excellence and implausibly high promotion rates 
" 10 years after he left the ship many people have been promoted and it's still getting awards. I agree with this; if you launch a great product but then don't leave it in a sustainable state, you are not a good leader.
[too pointed?]

Problem is that isn't what happens in tech, he talks about Caring but not caring - caring about subordinates and the organisation but little about the organisational consequences to yourself (note this is in 2 places atm) - 

he points out that we don't Don’t evaluate leaders’ effectiveness after they leave - this is my problem, the opposite - need to do more sales

To promote long term success he had to ignore the short term reward system 

## Clarity - context

He realised that not sharing the underlying thought process was the issue - no shortcuts - as the level
Of control is divested it becomes more and more important that the team be aligned with the goal of the organisation. 

Should have let officers figure it out, even tho tired. Emergency situations require orders but fee situations are emergency 

Don’t make decisions. If you constantly have to that is not good. p.92-93. How to do it.



Take time to let others respond to the situation. Create space for open decisions. 

f clarity of purpose is misunderstood then the criteria by which a decision is made will be skewed and suboptimal decisions will be made.  - this is not quite the same point as above

## Priciples

My own question about the creed, how much is this led/guided by the leader? E.g. assume good intent 

P.178 leadership not about creating a vision but tapping in...
If I were a crew member and faced with deciding between two different courses of action, would these principles provide me with the right criteria against which to select the appropriate course of action 

Making principles real. Used in evaluations. The questions are all around whether you are really using them/they are real. 

## More simliarities between the Navy and software development than I'd realised!

Some points he made resonated so much! For example, he said on ship there is a "constant tension between doing things right and meeting deadlines" – I shouldn't be surprised at these parallels but I was.

He also talked about a process that I recognise as a [blameless post-mortem](https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/) or retrospective, though he didn't call it that; they created a culture where they were open about mistakes and looked for ways to prevent or mitigate them rather than one where they wasted time and effort trying to avoid problems. He found when he arrived that the Crews actions motivated by “avoiding problems “ eg following a checklist, pleasing an inspector, looking good.

Connected to above is inspections, so maybe nto in this section?

Inspectors - welcoming - atmosphere of learning and curiosity among the crew Esther than defensiveness. Handing them a list of deficiencies so that they are on the agenda and will get resources to solve them. “I’m having a problem with this. What have you seen other ships do to solve it?”

How do we use outside groups, the public, social media comments and government audits to improve our organisation? 

What are the cost of being open about problem in your organisation? Well - step in with an unhelpful fix rather than supporting us to come up with a solution. 

He also talks about replacing general terminology with clear concise specific directions p.160 maybe link this in 

## Most important control is control over yourself

Summing up, he points out that the control you need is the self control to give control, which creates leaders. He says "rejecting the impulse to take control and attract followers will be your greatest challenge and, in time, your most powerful and enduring success."

## Conculstion

There was a lot more in the book than I have noted here, e.g. the value of feedback, [seomthigne esle mabye], and I would recommend reading it; it's also a slim volume so won't take too long. It's not just for those in a leadership position; for example he suggests that people at the front line might want to read it to embrace decision making, and /challenge leaders - if on my team and want to push me, or maybe leave this for the note in ft-next-dev

Made loads of notes, this is less than half of what i jotted down but key points for me right now

I really enjoyed this book because it completely reflected what I think of as good leadership; building a strong team that can run without you, growing and developing the people who report to you so they are doing a good job, building resilience and an emancipated team who can act to get to the right outcomes without needing to wait for instruction or permission; and it offered some really practical steps to help me get there and some good challenges to where I might think I am doign it already but could improve.

Questions to consider are good - less work than other books 


## Where does this slot in?

My goal in any job is to [make mysefl redundant](/jfdi/delegating-to-a-team.html)

Delegate everything, more than you are comfortable with
