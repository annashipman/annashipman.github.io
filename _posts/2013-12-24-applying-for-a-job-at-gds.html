<p>Over the next few months we will be recruiting for a number of roles,
including developers and web operations engineers. Since a civil service
application is a bit different to other jobs you might be applying for, we
thought it was worth explaining what the process involves, with some detailed
guidance on how to write the most unusual part of the application - a statement
of suitability.</p>

<h2>Open and fair process</h2>
<p>There are a number of measures in place to make it more likely that
applications to join the civil service are treated fairly and on their own
merit. You can <a

more about the civil service recruitment and selection guidance on the Civil
Service website</a>, but the main thing you should be aware of is that we try
and ensure objectivity by having consistent criteria that we assess applications
on.</p>
<h2>Consistent criteria</h2>
<p>The job advert will list some essential specialist skills and competencies.
The specialist skills are likely to be what you are familiar with in job
applications, for example for a WebOp, “Experience configuring and managing
Linux servers”.</p>
<p>The competencies are a bit more unusual. They reflect important civil service
behaviours, like leadership and delivering value for money, because we are
recruiting not just technical people, but people to become civil servants. This
helps us build a team of people who are not just great technically, but also
have other crucial skills, like communication and team-working.<br />
<a
href="http://resources.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Civil-Service-Competency-Framework-Feb2013.pdf">For
more information on civil service competencies you can look at this
document</a>. </p>
<h2>Why this matters to applicants</h2>
<p>One of the three documents we ask for in your application is a statement of
suitability, which is extremely important, as it is where you get a chance to
show the panel the evidence for how you meet the essential skills and
competencies described in the job advert. </p>
<p>If a candidate's application does not show evidence of even just one of the
competencies, we are not allowed to invite that candidate for interview. This
may seem a little harsh, but it's actually this kind of rule that tries to
ensure the process is open and fair.</p>
<p>Based on this, we can see how the statement of suitability is so important in
the application. Your CV is unlikely to provide quite the right sort of
information on its own, as CVs tend to be a collection of achievements and
responsibilities. The Statement of Suitability is your opportunity to fill out
the gaps in your CV and explain you have the experience to do a great job at
GDS. You must remember to give examples, as that is what we are looking for in
the application.</p>
<h2>How to write a good statement of suitability</h2>
<p>The main thing required in the statement of suitability is that you
demonstrate the essential skills and competencies asked for. Here is an
example.</p>
<p>We recently advertised for Web Operations Engineers (and will be doing so
again - watch this space!). One of the essential competencies we are looking for
is evidence of how you "coach and support colleagues to take responsibility for
their own development (through giving accountability, varied assignments and
on-going feedback)".</p>
<p>If you have managed a team, it should be fairly straightforward to think of
an example. But if you haven't, there are other ways you can provide this
evidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have done any person management, you might be able to give an example
of how you have assisted colleagues in writing their appraisals</li>
<li>you might be able to give an example of doing code reviews, or feedback on
pull requests, or helping someone learn how to script a manual process</li>
<li>you might have an example from non-work development activities, for example
if you volunteer at a Code Club or you have mentored someone in an Open Source
project</li>
<li>your examples don't have to be about something you did while working in a
technical role, for example if you coach a netball team you might be able to
give an example from that</li>
</ul>
<p>The point here is that we feel an ability to coach and support colleagues is
essential to being successful in the role, and we are looking for evidence that
you have done this in some context before.</p>
<h2>A word on how to phrase your answers</h2>
<p>It's good to give detail, but your answers don't have to be really long. The
best thing to do is think of the example you want to use and give us the
essential information.<br />
It may be useful to think of the CAR approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Context: what the situation was and what you were trying to achieve</li>
<li>Action: what you did</li>
<li>Result: what the outcome was.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've covered all these points, you will have structured your example to
give us all the information we need.</p>
<h2>How to structure the statement</h2>
<p>You might find it helpful to list each of the essential skills and
competencies as headings and give an example under each, or you may prefer to
write it in a letter or essay format. The structure is not important - just make
sure that you cover all of the essential competencies asked for.</p>
<h2>The other documents</h2>
<p>The other documents we require are your CV and CV cover sheet. There's
nothing different about how you should structure your CV compared to applying
for a job in the private sector.<br />
The CV cover sheet is a form which requires you to fill in some straightforward
details so that we know how to contact you. Download this from the very bottom
of the job application page, and  include it with your application. If you are
not already a civil servant you only need to complete three parts of this form.
For existing civil servants, you need to fill in more sections of the CV cover
sheet - your line manager should be able to help you with this.</p>
<h2>Interview stage</h2>
<p>Once we have sifted all of the applications we invite some of the applicants
to interview. All candidates are asked a consistent set of questions for that
role, and you are likely to also have to do some kind of coding or whiteboard
exercise. If you are called for interview, you will get more information about
what to expect in advance.</p>
