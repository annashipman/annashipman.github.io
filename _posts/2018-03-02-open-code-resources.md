One of my main aims as [Open Source Lead](/jfdi/a-year-in-the-life-os-lead.html) at the Government Digital Service was to make sure that there were good resources in place to help people code in the open. Many of these didn't exist when I started the role so I created them. I've collected useful resources here.

## The benefits of coding in the open

I was often asked what the value of coding in the open is to the teams
themselves, those who are opening the code. There is a lot of value. I've
shared that in various formats:

- Blog post on GDS blog: [The benefits of coding in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/)
- 30 min conference talk: [Coding in the open in government](https://www.turingfest.com/2017/engineering/anna-shipman?wvideo=0p810lpdqr)
- 2 min video: [Why we code in the open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=aqFFCvjXr1s)

## How to make your code open

- Official guidance on the Government Service Design Manual: [Making source code open and reusable](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)
- Blog post with examples: [How to open up closed code](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/19/how-to-open-up-closed-code/)
- GOV.UK [guidelines for licensing GDS code](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/licensing.md)
- [GDS open source guidelines](http://gds-operations.github.io/guidelines/) for open code that GDS explicitly intends to support

## Security when coding in the open

- Blog post on GDS technology blog: [Don't be afraid to code in the open: here's how to do it securely](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/27/dont-be-afraid-to-code-in-the-open-heres-how-to-do-it-securely/)
- Guidance: [When code should be open or closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed)
- Guidance: [Security considerations when coding in the open](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/security-considerations-when-coding-in-the-open)

From the security perspective, it's also worth knowing that while
[GCHQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters) don't code in the open, they have
released quite a bit of [open source code](https://github.com/gchq/).

## GDS open code

- GDS's GitHub organisation: [Alphagov](https://github.com/alphagov)
- GOV.UK have documented all of the GOV.UK code: [Developer docs](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/)
- [GOV.UK Verify code on GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=verify&type=&language=)
- [All posts about open code on the GDS technology blog](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/category/open-source/)

## Coding in the open across government

- [List of UK central government code on GitHub](https://government.github.com/community/#uk-central)
- Blog post by Ministry of Justice: [Why we code in the open](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/21/why-we-code-in-the-open/)
- Blog post by DWP: [Doing the hard work to make things open](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/24/doing-the-hard-work-to-make-things-open/)
- GCHQâ€™s most popular open source project: [CyberChef](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef)

## Let me know if there's anything else

I hope you find this list useful. I'll update it as things change so let me know if there's anything you'd like to see here.
