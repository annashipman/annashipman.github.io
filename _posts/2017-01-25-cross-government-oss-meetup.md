We are organising a series of cross-government Open Source meetups to exchange ideas, talk about code we can reuse or collaborate on and build a community around Open Source.

Making code open is the foundation of the transformation of government. One of the major benefits of open code is how easy it makes collaboration, and potentially reuse; saving other teams time and effort. As I wrote about in [my post outlining the next steps for open source in government](https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/12/15/next-steps-for-open-source-in-government/), the best way to make that happen is to talk to each other.

The first meetup will be co-hosted with the [Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice) (MOJ), on the afternoon of Friday 24th February, at MOJ's office in London.

There will be short talks from [GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk/), [Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office) and GDS about the Open Source work we’re doing. We will then have some discussion sessions, organised on [open space/unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) principles, so attendees can set the agenda for what they would like to cover. Throughout the afternoon there will be plenty of opportunities to talk to colleagues working on the same things in other departments.

This event is only open to people working in government (both civil servants and contractors are welcome). If you would like to attend, please sign up to the [cross-government technical architecture mailing list](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/join-the-conversation/) or ask for the sign up details in the [cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/open-code).

I hope to see you there to continue the interesting discussions we’ve started.
