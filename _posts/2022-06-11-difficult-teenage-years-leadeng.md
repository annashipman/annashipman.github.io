I delivered a talk at the inaugural London LeadingEng conference on [how to set a tech strategy, specifically after the launch](https://leaddev.com/technical-direction-strategy/difficult-teenage-years-setting-your-tech-strategy-after-launch).

This was an updated version of my [talk from Continous Lifecycle London in 2019](/jfdi/after-the-launch.html). It was planned to include learnings one year on, but the original LeadingEng was scheduled for summer 2020, so by the time we had the conference, I was able to include learnings three years on from setting the strategy.

Slides below, and the [video is on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/720550390/123b9a671b).
