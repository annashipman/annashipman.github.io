Earlier this year, I read [What got you here won't get you there](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84525.What_Got_You_Here_Won_t_Get_You_There). Great title. For me, the book didn't quite live up to my initial hopes, but it was interesting and thought-provoking. Here are my notes.

## The book is about bad habits that stop you progressing

Marshall Goldsmith is an executive coach, and this book is about the 20 behavioural habits that he sees executives having that prevent them getting to the next level.

He quotes Peter Drucker: "Half the leaders I have met don't need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop."

## Stop adding too much value

As a leader, you often know a lot about a piece of work, maybe more than the person you've delegated it to, and when they tell you your ideas for how to do it, you may try and add some value by suggesting an improvement to their plan.

However this is counter-productive because it is demotivating. "You may have improved the content of my idea by 5 per cent, but you've reduced my commentment to executing it by 50 per cent, because you've taken away my ownership of the idea... and I walk out of your office less enthused than when I went in."

He tells a story about someone he coached who developed the habit of taking a breath before replying to anything, and once they'd got into that habit, they realised half of what they had been about to say was not actually worth saying.

## Make sure you are clear about your goals

When are you in a hurry? All the time. So it is all the more important to make sure you know why you are doing what you are doing. You will always feel too busy or overcommitted.

(This reminded me of something I heard ages ago which I've found useful for things like agreeing (or not!) to do conference talks: don’t agree to do anything you wouldn’t do tomorrow. Because one day it will be tomorrow.)

He says part of being an effective leader is setting up systems to measure everything. That’s how you know how you are doing.

## Retention is about relationships

He talks about keeping people; “we would have done anything to keep her happy, we wanted to keep her”.

Your relationship with top talent is a strategic alliance rather than an employment contract.

Also, he says that Hawthorn found people work better if they believe their boss cares about their welfare.

## Ask for feedback often

Leaders who ask for input on a regular basis are seen as getting better. Remind people what you are trying to do by bringing up your objectives and asking “how am I doing?”

He also talks about what he calls "feedforward"; asking "what can I do to improve in the future?" This is a way colleagues can help each other.

## You are still you outside of work

Your flaws at work don’t vanish as soon as you get home.

He suggests you request feedback at home – what can I do to be a better partner/parent/friend?

This is a theme he goes more into in his subsequent book, [Triggers](https://www.marshallgoldsmith.com/product/triggers-creating-behavior-that-lasts-becoming-the-person-you-want-to-be/). I like this approach, that I've not seen in other management books, that your home/personal life and work life are areas equally worthy of your investment to improve.

## How to recalibrate if you find your staff "too needy"

He tells an interesting story about an executive who found they were spending too much time attending to requests for support from their staff. This is interesting because people are the most important thing, so if people feel they need your help, as a leader you want to be able to give it. However, at a certain point it can become too much of a burden, as in the story he tells.

This executive addressed it with two questions to their staff:

- "Your job: are there areas of your job where you think I am too involved or should be less involved?"
- "My job: do you see me doing things that a person at my level should not be worrying about?"

## Some suggestions about delegation

He suggests saying “I want you to do as much of my job as you can handle”.

You also have to remember you’re not managing you.

He quotes Drucker again; “know how to ask rather than tell”.

## Follow up is really important

He talks about an executive who asked for something to be done by sending a memo: Marshall asked them: how many read it, understood it, acted on it? The executive couldn't answer.

For things that you want to get done, you need to do follow-up. Send the message. Ask people the next day if they heard it. Then ask if they understood it. Then a few days later ask if they did something about it.

## Leadership Inventory

The book finishes with an appendix called the "Global Leadership Inventory", part of a research project sponsored by Accenture into what characteristics high potential leaders have. There are 72 (grouped into areas) and I made a note of a few that resonated with me:

- Effectively involves people in decision making
- Thrives in ambiguous situations (demonstrates flexibility where needed)
- Sees change as an opportunity not a problem
- Encourages creativity and innovation in others
- Effectively translates creative ideas into business results
- Demonstrates self confidence as a leader
- Anticipates future opportunities
- Understands competitive options available to customers
- Effectively manages technology to increase productivity
- Strives to arrive at an outcome with others
- Builds an organisation where people care about the greater good
- Achieves results that lead to long term shareholder value - holds people accountable for their results

## Some miscellanous things I liked

- People will do something only if it can be demonstrated that it is in their own best interests according to their own values.
- Make a 'to stop' list instead of a 'to do' list.
- Successful people stack the deck in their favour: the  best employees, the best PAs, etc
- Forgiveness means letting go of the hope for a better past.

## It's worth reading

Although I found this book didn't fulfil my early expectations, it was definitely an interesting read and made me reflect on some aspects of my own leadership style.
