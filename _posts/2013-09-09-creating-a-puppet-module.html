</ol>
<p>While creating the Puppet manifests for the GOV.UK mirror, we realised we
needed a module that was part of the GOV.UK Puppet, so our task was to pull it out into a standalone module and
have both GOV.UK and our new <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_mirror-puppet" target="_blank">GOV.UK
mirror</a> use it.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a new module is to pull it out into its own git
repository.<p>
<p>First, clone the repository the module is currently in. (Extra learning here:
you don't need to clone it from Github, you can just git clone the existing
repository.) You want <span class="code-sample-inline">--no-hardlinks</span> so it's entirely separate:</p>
<div class="code-sample">
git clone --no-hardlinks puppet puppet-auditd
</div>
<p>At this stage our puppet-auditd repo still points at our puppet repo, so we
want to remove the remote:</p>
<div class="code-sample">
git remote rm origin
</div>
<p><span id="git-filter-branch">Now</span> we want to get rid of everything that's not our module and make our module
the root, and this is where we use <a
href="http://teach.github.com/articles/lesson-filter-branch/" target="_blank">git
filter-branch</a>:</p>
<div class="code-sample">
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter modules/audit-d HEAD
</div>
<p>The next thing we want to do is create the files in the framework around the
subdirectory
to make it a Puppet module, for example the Modulefile. For this we can use our <a
href="https://github.com/gds-operations/puppet-module-skeleton"
target="_blank">Puppet module skeleton</a>. However, we don't want
to directly follow the instructions there as we already have a lot of the
classes we need. Instead of creating it from scratch as per those instructions,
we <span id="generate-module">generate our new module stucture</span>:<p>
<div class="code-sample">
puppet module generate gdsoperations-auditd
</div>
<p>and then then we copy over the generated files.</p>
<p>However, a normal recursive copy won't work:<p>
<div class="code-sample">
cp -r A/* B
</div>
<p>This will only copy non-dotfiles, and we want the dotfiles as well, like
.gitignore.</p>
<p>However, attempting to copy the dotfiles as well:</p>
<div class="code-sample">
cp -r A/.* B
</div>
<p>leads to hilarious results.  <span class="code-sample-inline">..</span> is a
directory too, so the above command copies all those contents recursively as
well. Try it. It's most entertaining. But it's not really what we want.
<p><span id="shopt">What</span> we can do is toggle what is included in <span class="code-sample-inline" >A/*</span> for this shell. The
documentation is <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html"
target="_blank">here</a>, but this is what we need:
<div class="code-sample">
shopt -s dotglob
</div>
<p>In order to check what is going to be copied now you can:<p>
<div class="code-sample">
echo A/*
</div>
<p>and if you like it:<p>
<div class="code-sample">
cp -r A/* B
</div>
<p>The next step is to go through the files to work out which modifications to
keep and which ones are not relevant.</p>

<p>Another tip from Dan: vimdiff is really useful for this task. I won't go into
how and what we decided; you can see that <a
