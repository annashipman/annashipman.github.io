<p>Over the last few months, I’ve been leading a small team <a title="vCloud
Tools" href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools">building tools</a> to
automate creation and configuration of our servers.</p>

<h2>Tools to automate provisioning</h2>
<p>Currently, our production environment is hosted with Skyscape, and we manage
it using <a href="http://www.vmware.com/uk/products/vcloud-director">VMware
vCloud Director</a>. Skyscape, and other providers using vCloud Director, expose
a UI for managing VMs and networks.</p>
<p>However, a UI isn't suitable when you need to bring a lot of machines up in a
repeatable, reliable way, for example when <a
href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/03/28/migrating-govuk-infrastructure/">migrating
the site to a new platform</a>. In addition, if you can automate provisioning,
the configuration files represent your infrastructure as code, providing
documentation about your system.</p>
<p>VMware vCloud Director supports the <a
href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vcd-51/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vcloud.api.doc_51%2FGUID-F4BF9D5D-EF66-4D36-A6EB-2086703F6E37.html">vCloud
API</a>, but there was no widely-available tooling to orchestrate this kind of
operation using the API. So we built <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools">vCloud Tools</a>.</p>
<h2>Our suppliers currently all use vCloud Director</h2>
<p>The UK Government’s policy is <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-adopts-cloud-first-policy-for-public-sector-it">cloud
first</a> and we procure services through <a title="CloudStore"
href="http://govstore.service.gov.uk/cloudstore/">CloudStore</a> (which uses the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-use-cloudstore#g-cloud-framework">G-Cloud</a>
framework). As government, it’s vital that we provide secure, resilient services
that citizens can trust, and we need various assurances from our suppliers to
support that.</p>
<p>There are a number of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms that are
able to provide these assurances, but when we procured our current suppliers
last year, the vendors that met our requirements (both technical and
non-functional, eg self-service provisioning, a pay-as-you go cost model) used
vCloud Director.</p>
<p>We very much want to encourage potential new suppliers, but given the
availability in the market, we can be reasonably certain we’ll be using at least
one VMware-based solution for at least the next 12-18 months, and it’s likely
that many other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transformation">transformation
projects</a> will also be drawing on the same pool of hosting providers. So it’s
definitely worth investing time to make provisioning easy.</p>
<h2>Preventing vendor lock-in</h2>
<p>Having an easy way to provision environments will allow us to move more
easily between vendors that use vCloud Director, which will help prevent
supplier lock-in. But we also don’t want to lock ourselves in to VMware, so we
are taking several steps to guard against that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We access the vCloud API via an Open Source library called <a
href="http://fog.io/">fog</a> which can communicate with multiple types of cloud
providers. If we add different vendor solutions in the future, we can extend our
existing tools.</li>
<li>Within our suite of vCloud Tools, the interaction with fog and the vCloud
API takes place in <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/vcloud-core">vCloud
Core</a>, which the other tools depend on. This means any changes to use a
different provider would be localised and should not affect the work we’ve done
in the other tools.</li>
<li>We’ve aimed to restrict our usage of VMware to functionality that has
equivalents on other platforms, for example, Load Balancers, Firewalls and NAT,
so we don’t have an infrastructure design that can’t be moved.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Previous iterations of provisioning tooling</h2>
<p>Automation of provisioning is something we’ve been iterating on since we
launched GOV.UK 18 months ago. Prior to vCloud Tools, we used a tool we had
built called vCloud Provisioner. This was really useful when moving onto our
first platform, but because it was built quickly it has a lot of hard-coded
detail about the environment, so it doesn’t help us be flexible when moving
between suppliers. In addition these hard-coded details include sensitive
information, so we can’t share it, meaning it cannot be useful to anyone outside
of the GOV.UK team.</p>
<p>Several members of the infrastructure team worked on subsequent iterations of
the provisioning tooling. These iterations included <a
href="https://github.com/gds-attic/vcloud-box-spinner">vCloud Box Spinner</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/gds-attic/vcloudtools">vcloudtools</a>. However,
the people working on these were building these tools alongside their other
business-as-usual work keeping <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> up and
running, so when they ran into issues, it was difficult to find time to address
them. With the <a
href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/03/28/migrating-govuk-infrastructure/">migration
to the new platform</a> looming, we needed to prioritise this piece of work in
order to be able to bring up a new environment quickly, reliably and easily.</p>
<h2>We think vCloud Tools will be more robust</h2>
<p>There are several things we have done to improve the chances of producing
robust, more widely useful tools in this iteration.</p>
<p>We have committed the time and resources to this, forming a small team who
focus entirely on vCloud Tools rather than firefighting or other operations
work, and we are <a
href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/">coding in the
open</a>, so we won’t fall into the trap of including sensitive information that
it is later too hard to factor out.</p>
<p>Not only are the GOV.UK team “<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one%27s_own_dog_food">eating our own
dogfood</a>” by using vCloud Tools to provision our new hosting environments,
there are two other GDS teams also using the tools, the <a
href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/01/23/what-is-identity-assurance/">Identity
Assurance Programme</a> and the <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/performance">Performance Platform</a>. Other exemplar
projects have started using the tools, and we have already accepted pull
requests from people we do not know, so there is the beginnings of a community
around the tools. This keeps us from making it too GOV.UK specific and means
that we get a lot of extremely useful user feedback.</p>
<p>And in the meantime we are contributing back to Open Source - in one <a
href="https://github.com/fog/fog/commit/e33ad6265">recent release</a> of fog, a
huge number of the contributions were from the GOV.UK vCloud Tools team (who
were, at that time, <a href="https://github.com/annashipman">me (Anna
Shipman)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/snehaso">Sneha Somwanshi</a>, <a
href="https://github.com/mikepea">Mike Pountney</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/danielabel">Dan Abel</a>).</p>
<p>These factors mean that we feel confident that we are going to produce tools
that will continue to be very useful to us and other teams for some time.</p>
<h2>More will follow</h2>
<p>There will be future posts about particular aspects of what we’ve done and
how, including one soon on how we used vCloud Tools in our platform migration.
