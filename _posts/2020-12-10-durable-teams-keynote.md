title: How Durable Teams Take You Further, Faster
layout: blog_post
---

Last week I gave a keynote at [CTO Craft conference](https://conference.ctocraft.com) based on my [blog post about moving to durable teams](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/unlocking-value-with-durable-teams-a70efb435a19).

It was an outline of why and how we made the move, and my reflections on how it's gone, one year on. The [slides are on Slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/annashipman/how-durable-teams-take-you-further-faster), and [video of the talk is on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/ctocraftcon2020), though currently this is only available to ticket holders; video should be more widely available next year.
