<p>As part of preparing the proposal for the JavaScript visualisations talk, I had a coffee with <a href="https://twitter.com/ian_alderson" target="_blank">Ian Alderson</a>. He did an excellent talk at SPA2011, along with Adam Iley, on HTML5. The presentation is still available online (using HTML5 for the slides!) <a href="http://webappsthatshine.com/presentation/" target="_blank">here</a>, I really recommend you check it out.</p>
<p>Although Ian doesn't have time to co-pilot on the talk, he very generously gave up his time to give me some advice. Notes below. The first suggestion of his that I plan to follow is a comparison between SVG and Canvas – as he pointed out, all JS visualisation libraries will be based on one or the other, so that will definitely be a factor in what library to choose. It's not the case that one is just better than the other – both have strengths and weaknesses. Watch this space for more on this topic...</p>
