A few weeks ago I joined Neal Ford on his [Software Architecture Hour](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/software-architecture-hour-technical-strategy-with-anna-shipman/0636920090704/0636920090703/) to talk about technical strategy. I really enjoyed this conversation; we covered a really broad range of topics, mostly driven by audience questions. We talked about building strategy and selling it, how to do architecture across big groups, how governance can not be a dirty word and more.
