On Tuesday, I delivered a talk at QCon London: [No Next Next: Fighting Entropy in Your Microservices Architecture](https://qconlondon.com/london2022/presentation/no-next-next-fighting-entropy-microservices-architecture).

This was my first in person conference talk since 2019, and I really enjoyed it.

I got some great questions after the talk, including questions about:

- how we set up durable teams (you can read more in the blog post [Unlocking value with durable teams](https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/unlocking-value-with-durable-teams-a70efb435a19)); 
- how we handled teams suddenly having to own a lot of tech they didn't know about (it takes time, and is still a work in progress; it's much better if you don't get into a situation where you have unowned tech in the first place);
- how to sell technical work to the business ([Talking like a suit](https://www.infoq.com/articles/communicating-engineering-work-business/) is an excellent article on that topic)
- and how to work on a tech strategy when there isn't a clear business or product strategy (I think that may be a whole other talk in itself!)

I also got asked a very interesting question about how to improve your storytelling. As I'd mentioned a couple of times in my talk, telling a good story is really important to communication. I didn't immediately have an answer, but I put it to Twitter.

I got some great suggestions, including:

- read and write a lot
- learn to analyse material, e.g. like you do in a screenwriting course
- improv
- Toastmasters
- think about story types, e.g. the Hero's journey ([This is an interesting post that outlines 8 story types](https://blog.sparkol.com/8-classic-storytelling-techniques-for-engaging-presentations)).

Slides from my talk are below and I will post a link to the video when it is available
