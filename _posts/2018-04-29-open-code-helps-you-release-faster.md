A few weeks ago I talked about how coding in the open can help you release faster at [PipelineConf](https://pipelineconf.info/). This was my last talk as Open Source Lead at the Government Digital Service. Here is the video, slides, links, and a bonus sketchnote!

I love to see sketchnotes of my talks, especially when they are as clear and nicely designed as this one. Thank you, Sarah!

## Links

Finally, I mention a lot of resources in my talk. Most of them can be found in this [list of useful open code resources](/jfdi/open-code-resources.html). Those specific to this talk are below.
