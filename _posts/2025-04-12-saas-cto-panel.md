Here is the video from my [panel at the SaaS CTO conference](/jfdi/ai-blessing-bandwagon.html).

We talked about:

- What does it mean for a technology to be transformative?
- How critical it is to be able to articulate tech in terms of a user need
- How to communicate to others in the business about the risks and potential value of GenAI
- Advice for people experiencing pressure to include it in their stack (e.g. by VCs) and suggestions as to how to get started.

It was a really interesting conversation with great contributions from my co-panellists [Mal Minhas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malminhas/) and [Chris Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evnsio/) and good facilitiation by [Jon Topper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtopper/) with some help from [Claude](https://claude.ai/).
