On Monday I was on a panel, organised by Codemotion, about technical leadership. It was a great discussion, with extremely impressive co-panellists [Omosola Odetunde](https://twitter.com/omosolatweets) and [Pat Kua](https://twitter.com/patkua), and well faciliated by [Piergiorgio Niero](https://twitter.com/pigiuz).

We discussed three main areas:

1. What challenged each of us the most as a senior technology leader at different stages of our growth.
1. What we delegate, and what are the key responsibilities we keep on ourselves.
1. What roles we see in senior technical leadership.

It was a really interesting discussion. You can watch it here:
