I recently joined Pat Kua on his Managing Managers podcast. We had a great conversation about many topics including strategy vs tactics, how to split your time as a technical leader and about my CTO role at [Kooth](https://koothplc.com/), digital mental health for children and young people.

You can listen to it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6vTH9rFOrzeEdiwCDsH7f2?si=H4-rHIq4S8Wwb_UVT_dVlg) or on the [Managing Managers site](https://managingmanagers.tech/episodes/episode-021-anna-shipman/) with show notes and a transcript.

PS. We are [hiring](https://koothplc.com/about-us/join-us), in the UK and US!
