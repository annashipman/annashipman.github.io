Yesterday, I delivered a talk at [LeadDev Together](https://events.leaddev.com/2022-S3-articulating-strategy): The good, the bad and the tech strategy.

I covered what strategy is and what makes a good strategy (both very much distillations of the excellent [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](/jfdi/good-strategy-bad-strategy.html), and then I talked about what a good tech strategy looks like.

My slides are below and I will post a link to video when I have it.
