There's a task I have to do every now and again for which `awk` is the best tool, but it's infrequent enough that I always have to remind myself how. Usually by referring back to [some shell scripts we wrote 5 years ago](https://github.com/alphagov/transition-config/blob/7bee2d60f5895893e8db26efa11ef73fc5d42f83/tools/businesslink_prune.sh), so thought I'd post here instead.

## Tell me how many different kinds there are

Given a CSV of people from different government organisations, tell me how many organisations are represented:

```
awk -F "," '{ print $4 }' output.csv | sort | uniq -c | wc -l
```
{:.code-sample}

Instead of `wc -l`, I usually pipe to a file so I can manually edit out duplicates like MOJ/MoJ/Ministry of Justice, but that's straightforward once I've done all that.

## While I'm here making notes of things I forget

```
find . -iname *utput*
```
{:.code-sample}
