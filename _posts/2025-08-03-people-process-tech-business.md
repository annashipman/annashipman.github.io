In March I gave a talk at CTO Craft Con that bought together a number of topics I've been thinking about for the past few years: how to be a great technology leader, being the best you can be at your job, and the true role of a CTO.

Becoming a successful technology leader requires skills in three core areas: people, process, and technology. Each leader has unique strengths in these areas, and rather than aiming to excel equally in all, focusing on your strongest areas will be far more effective.

Being the best you can be at your job, as well as being more rewarding personally, allows you to fulfill your primary role as a technology leader: to deliver buisness outcomes. As a leader, your peers are your first team, and working with them to lead your organisation is your most important role.
