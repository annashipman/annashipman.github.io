<p>My goal is to be a better developer.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I had an appraisal. There was a lot of positive feedback and
also some really useful suggested areas for development. With the help of my

<p>I'd be interested if any of you have suggestions for additions to this? What should a great developer know?</p>
