<p>My goal is to be a better developer.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I had an appraisal. There was a lot of positive feedback and also some really useful suggested areas for development. With the help of my good friend and unofficial mentor <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dolsonagile" target="_blank">Dolan O'Toole</a>, I pulled together some practical suggestions as to how I could improve them:</p>

<p>I then drew up a rough syllabus of the next steps I should focus on:</p>

<p>I'd be interested if any of you have suggestions for additions to this? What should a great developer know?</p>
