<p>When I started working on <a
href="https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2014/05/07/building-tools-to-provision-our-machines/">vCloud
Tools</a>, we had most of our functionality in one repository. There wasn’t a
clear separation of concerns – the code was <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_%28computer_programming%29">tightly
coupled</a> – and it also meant that a user who only wanted to use one tool to
do one job had to install the whole thing. So I pulled out each functional area
into an individual <a
href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/12/14/ruby-gems-%E2%80%94-what-why-and-how/">Ruby
gem</a>.</p>

<h2>Rewriting history</h2>
<p>When creating the repository for each new gem, I didn't want to lose all the
commit history; it is very <a
href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2014/02/hidden-documentation/">useful
documentation</a>. If I had started each gem from scratch, the commit history
would remain in the vcloud-tools repository, but I prefer not to have to go
somewhere else to see the history of what I'm working on right now.</p>
<p>I also didn't want to create each directory side-by-side and then delete the
unnecessary code, as this would make each repository much larger than it needed
to be (as Git stores all the history) and would essentially be several
duplicated projects with different bits deleted.</p>
<p>What I really wanted was to go back in time and to have started with this
structure from the beginning.</p>
<p>Luckily, Git provides a mechanism to do this: <a
href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-filter-branch.html">git
filter-branch</a>.</p>
<h2>Creating the new repository</h2>
<p>To get started, I cloned the existing vcloud-tools repository locally:</p>
<div class="code-sample">git clone --no-hardlinks /path/to/vcloud-tools-repo
newrepo</div>
<p>You need the <span class="code-sample">--no-hardlinks</span> flag because when cloning from a
repo on a local machine, files under <span class="code-sample">.git/objects/</span> are linked to
the original to save space, but I wanted my new repo to be an independent
copy.</p>
<p>I then deleted the remote in newrepo. I didn't want to push my new,
pared-down repo over vcloud-tools.</p>
<div class="code-sample">git remote rm origin</div>
<h2>Deleting irrelevant code</h2>
<p>Having made a new repository, I then pruned away any code that was unrelated
to that tool. So for example when pulling out vCloud Core, I pruned away all
directories that didn't contain vCloud Core code.</p>
<p>For this, I used a tree-filter. This checks out each commit and runs a shell
command against it, in this case <span class="code-sample">rm -rf c</span>, where c is an irrelevant
directory or file.</p>
<div class="code-sample">git filter-branch --tree-filter "rm -rf c" --prune-empty
HEAD</div>
<p>Because it's checking out each commit, it takes some time to do it this way
(though it speeds up, as using <span class="code-sample">--prune-empty</span> removes commits that
are left blank after the shell command does its job, so the total number of
commits decreases as you progress through the task).</p>
<p>This command actually allows you to use any shell command you want, but I
found that deleting things I didn't require one-by-one, while time-consuming,
meant that I picked up some things that had been missed, for example <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools/pull/93">files in the wrong
place</a> and <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools/pull/94">tidy-up</a> that <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-core/commit/9f0d27a3ab1dea3209f9775707393f1a2cd07">needed
to be done</a>.</p>
<h2>Tidying up</h2>
<p>After each time you run this command and prune away files or directories, you
need to do some cleanup. (I just wrote a little shell script and ran it each
time.)</p>
<p>When you run git filter-branch a <span
class="code-sample">.git/refs/original</span> directory is
created, to allow for a restore. These objects will be retained if you don't
remove them so you need to remove the references:</p>
<div class="code-sample">git for-each-ref --format="%(refname)" refs/original/ | xargs -n 1
git update-ref -d</div>
<p>These are usually cleaned up by Git on a scheduled basis, but because I was
going on to remove other folders, I wanted to expire them immediately, and then
reset to <span class="code-sample">HEAD</span> in case that had changed anything.</p>
<div class="code-sample">git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git reset --hard</div>
<p>Then, I forced garbage collection of all orphaned entities.</p>
<div class="code-sample">git gc --aggressive --prune=now</div>
<p>The final line of my shell script just output the size of the
<span class="code-sample">.git</span> folder so I could see it getting smaller as I pruned away
unneeded code.</p>
<div class="code-sample">du -sh .git</div>
<h2>Important warning!</h2>
<p>You need to be extremely careful when rewriting history. It is very important
not to do this on a public repository unless you have a <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data">very good
reason</a>, as it makes everyone else’s copy of that repository incorrect. So I
waited until it was finished and I was happy with my local version before
pushing it up to a <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-core">new
repository</a>.</p>
<h2>Applying gem structure</h2>
<p>For all tools other than vCloud Core, the first thing I had to do was redo
the <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-launcher/commit/c09090668acfef26df713110d05d0f4850c22163">directory</a>
<a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-launcher/commit/65178f291a909cdc517549b11e48a5d3731f97e7">structure</a>.</p>
<p>I also had to move the <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-launcher/commit/8c096a3cc70f6d96680080f4697f45d394e2cbbe">file
that loads the dependencies</a>, and during the pruning process is became clear
that we had a lot of dependencies at the wrong level, or <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-launcher/commit/f6327ba559348ca7309226ac2be83abee4316753">
not required at all</a>. Deleting code is very satisfying!</p>
<p>I then added the <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-core/commit/449e8d94a272c9bda73f069713798691c11f84ea">required
files</a> for a gem, for example a gemspec, a licence. At this point, I also
added a <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-net_launcher/commit/2dc595338e044336b92e36a543718789b1fa67c2">CHANGELOG</a>
to help us move the tools to <a
href="https://github.com/gds-operations/open-source-guidelines">open
source</a>.</p>
<h2>Some interesting things about Git</h2>
<p>I discovered some new things. For example, Git is case-insensitive with
regard to file names.</p>
<div class="code-sample">git mv spec/vcloud/fog/Service_interface_spec.rb
spec/vcloud/fog/service_interface_spec.rb</div>
<p>told me:</p>
<div class="code-sample">fatal: destination exists,
source=spec/vcloud/fog/Service_interface_spec.rb,
destination=spec/vcloud/fog/service_interface_spec.rb</div>
<p>You need to force it with the <span class="code-sample">-f</span> flag.</p>
<p>Also, you can copy commits from another repository, as if you were using
<span class="code-sample">git cherry-pick</span> to copy from a branch in the same repository, by <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9507417">creating a patch and applying it
locally</a>.</p>
<div class="code-sample">git --git-dir=../some_other_repo/.git \
format-patch -k -1 --stdout | \
git am -3 -k</div>
<h2>Then I published the gem</h2>
<p>To enable our continuous integration, I added a <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-core/blob/master/jenkins.sh">Jenkins
job</a> and a<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-webhooks">
Jenkins hook to GitHub</a>  so that a commit to master will trigger a build in
Jenkins.</p>
<p>Once I was happy that everything was present and correct and it was ready to
publish, I added a <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/gem_publisher">gem_publisher</a> <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-core/commit/3934e43f360e5d19ba7c97ec60f7987acfee2912">rake
task</a>, and then <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-core/commit/a6eaa1f9ee800bed3048074c94770cea9e035934">included
that in Jenkins</a>. This means that when a commit is merged to master, if the
tests pass and the version has changed, the new version is automatically
published to <a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>.</p>
<p>Ta-dah! <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/vcloud-core">vCloud Core</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I made a <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools/pull/116">pull request on vCloud
Tools</a> to remove it.</p>
<h2>Pulling out all gems</h2>
<p>Over a couple of months I pulled out all the gems and the architecture of
vCloud Tools now looks like this:</p>
<img src="/img/vcloud-tools-architecture.jpg" alt="hand-drawn diagram of vCloud Tools
architecture" />
<p>This approach follows the <a
href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">UNIX philosophy</a> of simple
tools that do one thing, which together can form a toolchain to do do more
complex tasks. vCloud Core now takes care of the interactions with fog and the
vCloud API, and the other tools depend on that. <a
href="https://github.com/alphagov/vcloud-tools">vCloud Tools</a> is now a
meta-gem that pulls in all the other gems as dependencies. This has definitely
made it easier to develop on and use vCloud Tools, and I learned a lot about Git
and Ruby gems along the way!</p>
