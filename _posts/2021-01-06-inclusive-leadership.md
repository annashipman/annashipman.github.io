I recently went on an inclusive leadership course at work. It was very interesting. There were four particular lists that I wanted to make a note of to refer back to:

## Do these

- Be bold about getting names right
- Start conversations about culture
- Explore how your culture affects others
- Learn to tell people of different ethnic groups apart
- Get a cultural calendar
- Be transparent about cultural norms and expectations
- Do unconscious bias training to find out about your implicit associations
- Get your staff trained to find their voice

## Don't do these

- Don't ignore cultural difference
- Don't place an emphasis on "fitting in"
- Don't tolerate cultural norms that are at odds with values
- Don't try to bleach manifestations of faith from the workplace
- Don't prevent staff from attending affinity groups in work time
- Don't try to stop minority groups using their community languages at work
- Don't invest resources in leaders at the expense of minoritised groups
- Don't forget to acknowledge "the other job" some people do

## What makes us more likely to act on our unconcious bias?

This was really interesting, very closely linked to the two systems concept in [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/thinking-fast-and-slow/9780141033570) and also the idea of "taking deliberate action" as a mechanism for preventing mistakes, in [Turn the Ship Around!](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/turn-the-ship-around-a-true-story-of-building-leaders-by-breaking-the-rules/9780241250945).

Here are some of the things that make us more likely to be biased in our actions:

- Conflicting priorities
- Deadlines
- Need for closure/quick decisions
- Being challenged
- Anxiety
- Low blood sugar
- Cold

It's always worth taking a bit more time over decisions, taking a break, a walk round the block, or having a cup of tea and a biscuit!

## Some examples of 'manners' leading to bias

She gave us some really good examples of how something that in one culture we might perceive as "good manners" are non-existent, or pereceived as bad manners in other cultures; something to be aware of when you are making snap judgments about people.

For example:

- eye contact means honesty
- it's not polite to talk about money
- it's rude to get too physically close
- please form a queue
- boasting is unseemly
- one should always say please

Reading this list, I can really feel how acting differently to some of those would provoke a reaction in me that is actually completely unjustifed as people have very different cultural norms.

## A course like this is worth doing

These are the lists I wanted to make a note of for my own future reference, though they represent only a small fraction of what was covered in the three hour workshop. I don't plan to write the rest of the course up. It's definitely worth seeking out such a course yourself if you can.
