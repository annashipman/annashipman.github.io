I was really happy to join Mal Minhas and Chris Evans on a panel at [The SaaS CTO conference](https://scalefactory.com/events/saas-cto-network/conference/2024/). 
Moderated by the excellent Jon Topper, we covered what criteria we use to differentiate between genuinely transformative technologies and overhyped trends, how we communicate the value and risks of adopting new technologies to stakeholders outside of technology, and what advice we'd give to a tech leader on how to get started with AI.

There is a [short-writeup on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/the-scale-factory_saasctocon2024-activity-7239949834449793024-gh7B) and I will share the video when published.
