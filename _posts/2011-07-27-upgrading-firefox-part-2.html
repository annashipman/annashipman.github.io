<p>Right, it turned out my next step was not a chat with Joe Halliwell but
instead with my good friend and mentor, <a href="https://twitter.com/boffhaku">Dolan O'Toole</a>, and what I thought might be a voyage of discovery into how to make my installation of firefox run like a normal program turned out to be just a short trip of discovery to finding out that I hadn't actually been looking in the right places.</p>

<p>After helpfully pointing out that I "sound like a linux newbie :)" (yes, yes I am), Dolan explained where I'd gone wrong: "You followed the instuctions as they are. The only thing you weren't aware of is that most of the time, someone would have done a build of a program for ubuntu and put it in an apt repository, usually on launchpad. I usually search for something like "firefox 5 ubuntu 10.10" if I need to install something before I resort to manual installations."</p>

<p>Good tip, and here it is:</p>

<p>So – I have learned that it's not quite as straightforward as finding the instructions and then following them – you also have to know stuff. That's OK though. And at least I have firefox the way I want it now. I'm sure there'll be another opportunity to get my hands dirty...</p>
