In June, I delivered a talk at [Turing Fest](https://turingfest.com/) on how to create a strategy. Here is a brief write-up and the video and slides.

## It covered what I wanted to know when starting out in strategy

When I first starting working on strategy, the question I had was 'how do you actually *do* it?'. Since then, having read a lot, been on some courses and practiced a lot, I now have a better idea; and the purpose of this talk was to share what I myself would have wanted to know when starting out.

## Some models for analysising, deciding and doing

Building a strategy comes in three stages: first you analyse your situation and make a diagnosis; then you decide how to address it; and then you enact your strategy.

This talk goes through some models that help with that.

For analysising, we look at:

- PESTLE
- S-curves
- Five forces
- Distinctive capabilities using VRIN
- Value chain analysis
- SWOT

For deciding, we look at:

- Three horizons
- Ansoff matrix
- Blue Ocean strategies and the Strategy Canvas
- SAFe (Suitable, Acceptable, Feasible, not Scaled Agile Framework!)
- Weighting and scoring
- Sophie Dennis' smell tests

and for doing, we look at:

- communicating
- showing progress
- managing change
- using the strategy
