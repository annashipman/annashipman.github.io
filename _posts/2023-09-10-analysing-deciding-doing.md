In June 2023, I delivered a talk at [Turing Fest](https://turingfest.com/) on how to create a strategy. This talk is the one I would have liked to have seen when writing my first strategy: how you actually do strategy.

## Watch the talk!

## Summary of the talk: models and techniques to help you create your strategy

In the talk, I go through some specific models, with examples.

- Analysing the situation: how to reach a diagnosis, including models like PESTLE, S-curves, Five Forces, VRIN, and value chain analysis.
- Making a strategic decision: how to make a strategic choice, including Three Horizons, Ansoff matrix, Blue Ocean strategies, and weighting and scoring.
- Making it happen: how to implement your strategy, including communication, managing change and showing progress.

These tools, techniques and actionable advice will set you up to be able to create and deliver an effective strategy.
