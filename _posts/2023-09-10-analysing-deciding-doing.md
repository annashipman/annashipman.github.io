In June, I delivered a talk at [Turing Fest](https://turingfest.com/) on how to create a strategy. Here is the video, the slides and a short write-up.

## It covered what I wanted to know when starting out in strategy

When I first starting working on strategy, the question I had was 'how do you actually *do* it?'. Since then, having read a lot, been on some courses and practiced a lot, I now have a better idea; and the purpose of this talk was to share what I myself would have wanted to know when starting out.

## It covers models and techniques to help you create and drive your strategy

In the talk, I go through some specific models, with examples.

- Analysing the situation: how to reach a diagnosis, including models like PESTLE, S-curves, Five Forces, VRIN, and value chain analysis.
- Making a strategic decision: how to make a strategic choice, including Three Horizons, Ansoff matrix, Blue Ocean strategies, and weighting and scoring.
- Making it happen: how to implement your strategy, including communication, managing change and showing progress.

These tools, techniques and actionable advice will set you up to be able to create and deliver an effective strategy.
